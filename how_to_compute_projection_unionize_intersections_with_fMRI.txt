1. Enter image series ids, structure ids, and mask id in config file on E drive (ssd). There is a separate folder for flipped data and separate config files.

2. The comupte_unionizes.py script that I am using is slightly modified from Nile's version. My version is stored in dropbox\python_code\jenniferwh\DMN. Run the script on the command line from E:\fMRI_unionize or E:\fMRI_unionize\flipped with the following command:

python c:\users\jenniferwh\dropbox\python_code\jenniferwh\DMN\compute_unionizes.py aim_two_ctx_hipp_selected.json [output path] aim_two_flipped_ss False

explanation: python [path to script] [name of config file - stored in inputs\config under the cwd] [output path - created under outputs in cws] [T/F create new structure overlap files - set to false if they have already been created or True to create new structure overlaps as in with a new fMRI overlap mask]

3. Move outputs from the E drive in block\unionizes to \\AIBSDATA\mousecelltypes\T503_Connectivity_in_Alzheimer_Mice\Jennifer\fMRI data from Alessandro\fMRI CCF overlap improved registration\unionizes in the corresponding folder for the dataset. Starting to create two folders in each of these parent folders for regular and flipped.

4. run 2017_03_23 JDW fMRI unionizes regular and flipped Aim 2 (or equivalent to be created). Output will be saved as a csv.
